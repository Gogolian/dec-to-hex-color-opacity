# Decimal to Hex Color opacity

No need to try and calculate hex opacity in your head anymore!

- Type new color (eg. #2E2 or #FFFFFF)
- Or put cursor after the existing one
- type . and two digits that would represent decimal percentage of your opacity (eg. #ccc.99)
- Your decimal opacity is now hex!
